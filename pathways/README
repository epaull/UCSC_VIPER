	Supplementary Information
	Curated TF Regulons Assembly
	We created a compendium of Transcription Factors (TF) and their targets (TF regulons) by 
	combining information from four databases - The SuperPathway[1], The Literome[2],Multinet[3], 
	and ChEA[4].
	SuperPathway
	Pathways were obtained in BioPax Level 3 format, and included the NCIPID and BioCarta 
	databases from http://pid.nci.nih.gov, the Reactome database from http://reactome.org, and the 
	set of signaling and metabolic pathways in the last public release of the KEGG database. Gene 
	identifiers were unified by UniProt ID then converted to Human Genome Nomenclature 
	Committee’s HUGO symbol using mappings provided by HGNC (http://www.genenames.org/). 
	Interactions from all of these sources were then combined into a merged Superimposed 
	Pathway (SuperPathway).
	Genes, complexes, and abstract processes (e.g. “cell cycle” and “apoptosis”) were retained and 
	referred to collectively as pathway features. Before merging gene features, all gene identifiers 
	were translated into HUGO standard identifiers. Interactions involving complexes were mapped 
	to the constituent gene members of each complex. Finally, we retained only the links that 
	correspond to regulation on transcriptional level.
	Literome
	We filtered down the network to include only transcription links in which the regulator is a known 
	transcription factor.
	Multinet
	We limited the network to links that correspond to regulation on transcriptional level.
	ChEA
	We used data from the Gene Expression Atlas[5] to filter the inferred links in the ChEA 
	database[4]. Specifically, we applied the context likelihood of relatedness(CLR)[6] to compute a 
	strength-of-interaction score for all gene pairs. We then intersected the top 10% by CLR score 
	with the ChEA network - the overlap represents the retained links.
	The combined network includes 76059 transcriptional regulatory links between 6734 regulators 
	and their targets. We further filtered this set down to regulators with at least 15 targets to reach 
	our final network of 419 TFs with 61 504 total targets in their regulons.
